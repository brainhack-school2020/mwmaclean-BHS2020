This project is part of the Brainhack School 2020

Team contributors: Michèle MacLean & Brainhack School


## Summary 

Hello! I'm currently a PhD student in Cognitive Neuroscience at l'Université de Montréal. I study cortical visual impairment and blindsight using MRI techniques. The overall goal of the current project is to become more proficient with tools to organize, analyze and visualize MRI data.

  

## Project definition 

### Background
 I plan on using a variety of tools learned during the BrainHack Summer School. I would like to apply these tools on MRI data acquired at l'Unité de Neuroimagerie Fonctionnelle here in Montréal. I'm very interested in working with a team or perhaps joining projects if possible! 
 

### Tools 
* GitHub
* Python 
* Jupyter Notebook 
* Standards to share science (i.e. BIDS)
* fMRI preprocessing
* Data visualization tools, etc.



### Data 
A preliminary pilot data set of 5 subjects (including 1 individual with cortical visual impairment).
Raw structural MRI, resting state functional connectivity, fMRI and diffusion MRI data avaiblable.


### Deliverables
* Readme file
* Python script for the main analyses 
* Jupyter notebook (including explanations)
* Data visualization graphs
* Requirements.txt



## Results 
TBD
