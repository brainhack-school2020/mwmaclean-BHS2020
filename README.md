## Summary 

Hello! I'm currently a PhD student in Cognitive Neuroscience at l'Université de Montréal. My main focus is to study cortical visual impairment using MRI techniques. Damage to the primary visual areas can result in clinical blindness and prompt a cascade of dynamical structural and functional alterations of the neural networks at both the cortical and subcortical level. Following this damage, individuals can sometimes preserve the ability to non-consciously process visual information in their blind field, a striking phenomenon know as blindsight. My fascination resides in understanding how the brain can process visual information without conscious awareness.

The overall goal of the current project was to use the new tools learned during the BrainHack Summer School to organize, preprocess, analyze and visualize diffusion MRI data acquired at l'Unité de neuroimagerie fonctionnelle during my PhD.

# Project definition 

## Background

This project explored the steps for analyzing diffusion magnetic resonance imaging data starting from the raw data all the way to data visualization. For this, I used previously acquired data from l'Unité de Neuroimagerie Fonctionnelle in Montréal. 

**Project objectives during BHS 2020:** 
The first steps were to **1)** organize the MRI data in a BIDS friendly format and then **2)** preprocess the data. Then, I  explored **3)** analyzing diffusion MRI (i.e. tracking) and **4)** performed data visualization.

**Overarching goal:**
The long term goal is to investigate the consequences of a primary visual cortex lesion on structural and functional connectivity using both diffusion MRI and resting state functional connectivity.

## Tools 
This project will rely on the following:
* **GitHub** for creating a repository & assembling all the resources.
* **Bash terminal**
* **Visual studio code** as a code editor
* **BIDS** as a standard to organize the neuroimaging data
* **Python** 
* **Docker container** to run preprocessing pipeline and basic tracking
* **DIPY** for preprocessing and basic tracking of diffusion MRI
* **Jupyter Notebook** and for data visualization
* **Interactive data visualization tools**: Nilearn, Plotly, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Widgets, etc.


## Data 
MRI data was acquired with a high resolution 3 Tesla scanner (Siemens Trio system) and consists of a preliminary data set of 5 subjects, including 1 individual with cortical visual impairment with blindsight and 4 neurotypical controls. For each participant, raw structural MRI, resting state functional connectivity, fMRI and diffusion MRI data is avaiblable. 

Given the time course of the summer school, after the initial preprocessing of the data, I focused on working with the diffusion MRI data. This data set will allow to first become familiarized with the new neuroimaging tools learned during the BrainHack summer school. When I will acquire a larger data set, during the rest of my PhD, I plan to incorporate it to this project.

The figure above is an example of an individual with cortical visual impairment to give you an idea of the type of data, where A) shows a T1-weighted anatomical scan with three different slice views showing the primary visual cortex removal in the left hemisphere and the destruction of the primary visual areas (V1) and B) the individual's visual field showing a symmetric loss across both eyes leading to a complete contralateral visual loss in the right visual field.

As the dataset is not yet open access, feel free to send me a message if you have any questions and I'll be happy to answer!

## Methods
1. **Data Organization/Management.**
* Convert dicoms to a BIDS friendly dataset. [This tutorial](http://reproducibility.stanford.edu/bids-tutorial-series-part-1b/) served as a guideline.

2. **Preprocessing diffusion MRI data.**
* Running a preprocessing pipeline using [this docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/gkiar/dwipreproc_fsl-5.0.11_minified)
* [This python script](https://github.com/gkiar/stability/blob/master/code/preprocessing/preprocessing_pipeline.py) was used within the docker container.
* Labels from Klein & Tourville (2012) were applied.

3. **Creating a seed mask.** 
* [This python scricpt](https://github.com/gkiar/mask2boundary) was used to create a seed mask for each participant.

4. **Tracking of diffusion weighted images (DWI)**
* [This docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/gkiar/dipy_tracking) was used to perform tracking of the diffusion data.
* [This python script](https://github.com/gkiar/stability/blob/master/code/tractography/dipy/dipy_tracking.py) was used within the container. This script is based off of [this tutorial](https://dipy.org/documentation/1.0.0./examples_built/tracking_introduction_eudx/) for DIPY tracking.

5. **Data visualization**
* Data visualization was performed within a Jupyter notebook using Plotly, Nilearn, Matplotlib, Seaborn and more (see visualization examples with gif below).

## Conclusion 
The BrainHack Summer School 2020 provided a theoretical framework as well as an extensive set of practical neural data analysis and visualization tools that were mainly all new to me. For the current project, my goal was to maximize using these new tools, to learn and apply the open science protocols in order to analyze data within my own doctoral project. Within the time frame of the summer school, I set out to perform all the steps starting from raw diffusion MRI data, which I previously acquired at l'Unité de neuroimagerie fonctionnelle, leading to data visualization. In particular, this dataset was organized into a BIDS friendly format, preprocessed with a python script within a docker container, basic tracking was also performed using another python script within a second container and finally data visualization was done using multiple librairies within a jupyter notebook. As a neuroscientist with a limited previous background in programming, I believe I sensibly improved my skills towards performing independently the whole process to analyze neuroimaging data. As I plan to continue working on this project with the new tools learned, my next immediate step will be to increase the number of subjects. Also, my next challenge will be to specifically account for brain injuries leading to cortical visual impairment during the analyses as this requires additional algorithmic tools and modifications to the preprocessing and analysis pipelines.
